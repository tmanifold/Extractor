# Extractor

###How To:


####Selecting the files to be extracted:

  The easiest way to do this is to select the "..." button next to the text box labeled "Source". After the files are   selected, their individual paths will appear in the Source text box, and the destination will automatically be determined based on the location of the selected files.


####Selecting the destination:
  
  The destination is the directory in which the selected files will be extracted to. As mentioned above, this field will automatically populate when the files are selected. The destination can be changed by manually typing a path, or by clicking the "..." button next to the text box labeled "Destination"
  
####Additional Options:

#####Delete .zips after extracting:
When a selected zip file contains more zip files, they also get extracted to their own subdirectory. This option will delete those zip files after they have been extracted to avoid clutter.

#####Fix directory names:
This application was developed for one of my instructors at my college. He requested that the directories be renamed based on a set of specific criteria. This option will likely do nothing for you, but if any of your files contain the word "attempt" it will be renamed.

#####View files after extraction:
Opens the destination directory in windows explorer after extraction has been completed.
